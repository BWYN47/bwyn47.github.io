<!-- ABOUT ME -->
<section id="about" class="about-container">
  <div class="aboutme-title">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
  </div>
        <p>I’m an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in security fundamentals, Linux systems, and core security practices.<br>
        I’ve earned entry level certifications and continue to build hands-on experience through labs, virtual environments, and ongoing learning.<br>
        Currently I am working toward CompTIA certifications to further expand my technical skills.</p>

        <p>My interests are threat detection, system hardening, penetration testing, and incident response.<br>
        I enjoy breaking down complex concepts and applying them in practical real world scenarios.
        I like to challenge myself and am driven by constant learning and self improvement.</p>

        <p>I’m looking for opportunities where I can contribute, learn from experienced professionals, and continue growing into a well rounded IT professional.</p>

        <p>Outside of tech, I value a healthy work life balance and enjoy spending time outdoors whether at the beach, on the golf course, or with family.</p>

<!-- MY GOALS -->
<section id="goals" class="goals-container">
  <div class="goal-title">
      <h2>Goals</h2>
  </div>
        <p>My goal is to continue building a strong foundation in cybersecurity and master the skills needed to protect systems, networks, and data from real world threats.<br>
        I am actively learning and gaining hands-on experience in areas such as networking, system administration, and security fundamentals.<br>
        As I continue to progress, I aim to transition into a pen-testing role where I can ethically test and strengthen security defenses.<br>
        I am motivated by continuous learning, problem-solving, and the challenge of staying ahead in an evolving digital landscape.<br>
